# Bare Bones App

This is a minimal web application that serves as a starting point for further development.

## Running the Application

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `src/index.html` file in a web browser.

That's it! You should see the bare bones application running in your browser.

## Modifying the Application

### HTML (src/index.html)

- The main content of the page is within the `<div id="app">` element.
- You can add more HTML elements inside this div or create new sections as needed.

### CSS (src/styles.css)

- The `styles.css` file contains basic styling for the application.
- Modify existing styles or add new ones to change the appearance of your app.

### JavaScript (src/main.js)

- The `main.js` file contains the JavaScript code for the application.
- It currently logs a message to the console and adds a paragraph to the page.
- You can add more functionality by writing additional JavaScript code in this file.
